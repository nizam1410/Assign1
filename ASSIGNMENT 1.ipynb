    "(2.)Boolean: A boolean is a data type which can have one of the outputs either TRUE or False. The in function is based on the same boolean logic. A number except 0 is always represented as True and if its 0 then, False. Similiarly, whitespaces are considered as False, while other values are considered as True.\n",
